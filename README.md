# ATM_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM

**📌 Project Overview:**

The ATM Management System is a console-based Python application that simulates the basic working of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is designed for students and beginners to understand core programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, loops, and OOPS concepts.

  It allows users to securely perform banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and changing PIN.

  
**OBJECTIVES:**

To understand real-time banking operations logic

To practice Python programming fundamentals

To improve problem-solving and logical thinking

**FEATURES:**

*    Creation of the bank account
*    Set a pin for security purpose
*    Balance Enquiry if you enter the correct pin
